## Background

`The Echo Nest`, before their acquisition by Spotify, represented the comprehensive algorithmic analysis of music. Each song within Spotify's [track analysis API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-analysis/) has been meticulously pre-analyzed: broken up into individual beats, segments, tatums, bars, and sections. With some clever elbow grease, it's possible to leverage these values with enough granularity to create meaningful visual experiences.

Since then, moving beyond the Echo Nest: I've developed a suite of tooling for _realtime_ audio analysis, right in the browser: on **any** device.

## Changelog

#### Version 10.0
